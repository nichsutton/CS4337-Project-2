For this session I will plan to finish a large portion of this project.

These are the tasks I will try to accomplish:
- Write the predicate find_exit/2 and make sure it will functino when passed a maze parameter and a list of actions
- Verify that the predicate can successfully navigate the maze from the start space to any exit space
- The preciate should work even when called with an unbound variable as a second parameter
- The predicate should fail if the maze is invalid, the actions do not lead to an exit space, or the actions lead the agent to moving off the maze or onto a wall
